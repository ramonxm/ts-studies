# TypeScript Studies

This repository is dedicated to my studies in TypeScript, a programming language that adds static typing to JavaScript, providing more robustness to application development.

## Objective

The main goal of this repository is to document and organize my progress in learning TypeScript. Here, you will find a variety of topics related to TypeScript, from basic concepts to advanced techniques.

## Covered Topics

- **Introduction to TypeScript**: Basic concepts, installation, and initial configuration.
- **Data Types**: Exploration of primitive types such as number, string, boolean, and more advanced types like arrays and objects.
- **Interfaces and Custom Types**: How to define and use interfaces, types, and generic types.
- **Functions in TypeScript**: Optional parameters, default parameters, and arrow functions.
- **Classes and Inheritance**: Use of classes to create objects and the implementation of inheritance in TypeScript.
- **Modules and Namespaces**: Code organization into modules and namespaces for modularization.
- **Generics**: Use of generics to create more flexible and reusable components.
